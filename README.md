## Boilerplate for Phaser 3 in Typescript

[Phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser) is a fast, free, and fun open source HTML5 game framework. This is a boilerplate for people coding Games in TypeScript for Phaser 3 with Webpack.
I have used the Typescript definition file from [@troyedwardsjr](https://github.com/troyedwardsjr/phaser3-typescript-webpack).

Feedback is always welcome!

### Install

Navigate to the folder and clone this repository.

Building and running is as easy as the three following steps:

1. `navigate to root folder`
